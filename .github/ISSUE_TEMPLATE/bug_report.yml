        Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. 
        It is very important for the snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim 
        down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently.

        Please also paste or describe the results you observe instead of the expected results. 
        If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the **full** traceback of the exception. 
        It may be relevant to wrap error messages in ```` ```triple quotes blocks``` ````.
